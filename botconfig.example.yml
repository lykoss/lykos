# lykos configuration file
# Common values are commented below, but not every valid configuration is present in this file.
# For documentation on all valid configuration elements, see https://ww.chat/config
# To configure your bot, COPY this file to "botconfig.yml" and customize it to your liking.
# When adding additional lines to this file, ONLY USE SPACES TO INDENT, NEVER TABS;
# our configuration reader is picky and indenting with tabs or not matching surrounding indents will cause errors.
# If you need additional assistance with formatting for this file, look up YAML syntax on your favorite search engine
# or come talk to us on irc.libera.chat #lykos

# The file named botconfig.yml is always loaded. A secondary file can be loaded as well which will
# overwrite settings in the main botconfig.yml file, based on command line switches.
# Running `wolfbot.py --config botconfig.foo.yml` will attempt to load botconfig.foo.yml.
# When run with --debug, the file botconfig.debug.yml will be loaded if it exists.
# This is loaded after the file specified by --config, if any.
# Instead of command line params, you can also use the environment variable BOTCONFIG to point to a configuration
# file (will be loaded if --config is not specified) and the environment variable DEBUG to enable debug mode.

# The transports section defines all of the connections your bot will make.
# At least one transport must be defined for the bot to successfully run.
# An example transport is provided below; you can tweak it for your own network.
# Currently, the irc transport *must* be defined first, otherwise the bot will error.
transports:
  - type: irc
    # Name of this transport. Can be anything, but must be defined and unique across all transports in this file.
    # Many other config sections let you specify a transport for something; those must match the name of a transport
    # defined here.

# Bot access. Access entries specified here cannot be modified or removed via the fflags command.

# Logging. The bot can log data to files as well as to destinations on transports (such as IRC channels).

# admin-commands => logs all usages of all admin commands
# warnings => logs all usages of the fwarn commands which add/delete/modify warnings
# debug => logs all exception reports

# Telemetry. lykos sends error details to the developers to help provide a better and more stable bot.
# To help preserve the privacy of your users, we anonymize data by default. However, opting in to sending us
# more data can help us solve errors faster or know how to prioritize development efforts.
# To send more data to the lykos developers, uncomment the following block:

# Reaper. Users that leave during the game or are otherwise idle will be automatically removed from the game
# after a period of time (by killing them in-game). This allows a game to continue onwards with the active players
# rather than being in a standstill. It is recommended to keep the reaper enabled for this reason, however the reaper
# will also automatically issue warning points to users by default, which can eventually cause stasis (aka time-outs)
# or temporary bans from the channel.
